			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi ! I'm an API Technical writer based in Wakefield, Quebec working at Shopify. I primarily work on developer documentation for our REST and GraphQL APIs, and I also help to co-ordinate a team of writers that works on partner-facing docs.<p>
      <p>I got my start in technical communications as employee number five of a startup in Montreal, and I was happy to grow and learn with that company as I wore many hats over a ten year span. The experience taught me a lot about startup culture and business in general,
        and I like to think that it prepared me well for the experience of working at Shopify.</p>
      <p>In 2017 I was invited to give my talk <a href="https://pronovix.com/event/api-docs-london-2018">"Documenting GraphQL at Shopify"</a> at API the Docs in London. I was lucky enough to be invited back in 2018 to give another talk called <a href="https://pronovix.com/event/api-docs-london-2018">"The trials and tribulations of the API style guide"</a>.
        In 2018 I worked with Matthew Buttler and a team of co-organizers at Shopify to reboot the a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-YOW-Ottawa/">Write the Docs Ottawa</a> meetup at Shopify. We had a full year of programming including talks by <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/">Mark Baker</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/singlesourceror/?originalSubdomain=ca/">Rob Hanna</a>.</p>
